# Personal Sandbox Site

This project was created to function as a portfolio/note-posting site. Another aim was also to create a sandbox site to play with styling, designs, and general web design/development (though not at a professional level).

Anyone can fork this project to make/design their personal static site. A way of doing it free is to deploy the site on Github Pages (but with the catch being its problem with React Routers) or Vercel.

This project was developed using React. Its functional structure made development relatively smooth and quick (less than few days). The site will go through near-daily updates. It would be great if a viewer notices a bug or a weird issue and let me know!
